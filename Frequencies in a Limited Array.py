# You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. 
# The elements in the array arr[] range from  1 to n (where n is the size of the array), 
# and some numbers may be repeated or absent. 
# Your have to count the frequency of all numbers in the range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] represents the frequency of the number i (1-based indexing).


class Solution:
    def frequencyCount(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        freq = [0] * n
        
        for num in arr:
            if 1 <= num <= n:
                freq[num - 1] += 1
        
        return freq
