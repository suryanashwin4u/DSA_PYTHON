# Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. 
# Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. 
# There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that -
#       i. Each student gets exactly one packet.
#      ii. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number is minimum and return that minimum possible difference.

# Time Complexity: O(n log n)
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def findMinDiff(self, arr, m):
        arr.sort()

        ans = float('inf')

        for i in range(len(arr) - m + 1):
            ans = min(ans, arr[i + m - 1] - arr[i])

        return ans
