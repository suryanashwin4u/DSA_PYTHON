# You are given an array arr[] of integers, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array. 
# Next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element.
# If there does not exist next greater of current element, then next greater element for current element is -1.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Auxiliary Space: O(n)

class Solution:
    def nextLargerElement(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        ans = [-1] * n
        stack = []

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while stack and stack[-1] <= arr[i]:
                stack.pop()

            if stack:
                ans[i] = stack[-1]

            stack.append(arr[i])

        return ans
