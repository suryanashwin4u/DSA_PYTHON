# Implement a Queue using an Array, where the size of the array, n is given.
# The Queue must support the following operations:

# (i) enqueue(x): Insert an element x at the rear of the queue.
# (ii) dequeue(): Remove the element from the front of the queue.
# (iii) getFront(): Return front element if not empty, else -1.
# (iv) getRear(): Return rear element if not empty, else -1.
# (v) isEmpty(): Return true if the queue is empty else return false.
# (vi) isFull(): Return true if the queue is full else return false.

# There will be a sequence of queries queries[][]. The queries are represented in numeric form:

# 1 x : Call enqueue(x)
# 2: Call dequeue()
# 3: Call getFront()
# 4: Call getRear()
# 5: Call isEmpty()
# 6: Call isFull()
# You just have to implement the functions enqueue, dequeue, getFront, getRear, isEmpty and isFull and the driver code will handle the output.
