# Given two integer values n and r, the task is to find the value of Binomial Coefficient nCr

# A binomial coefficient nCr can be defined as the coefficient of xr in the expansion of (1 + x)n that gives the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects without considering the order.
# The binomial coefficient nCr is calculated as : C(n,r) = n! / r! * (n-r) !
# Note: If r is greater than n, return 0.
# It is guaranteed that the value of nCr will fit within a 32-bit integer.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def nCr(self, n, r):
        if r > n:
            return 0

        r = min(r, n - r)

        ans = 1

        for i in range(r):
            ans = ans * (n - i)
            ans = ans // (i + 1)

        return ans
