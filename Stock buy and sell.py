# Given an array arr[] denoting the cost of stock on each day, 
# the task is to find the maximum total profit if we can buy and sell the stocks any number of times.

# Note: We can only sell a stock which we have bought earlier and we cannot hold multiple stocks on any day.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Auxiliary Space: O(n)

class Solution:
    
    # Function to find the days of buying and selling stock for max profit.
    def stockBuySell(self, arr):
        
        profit = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            
            if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
                profit += arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
                
        return profit
