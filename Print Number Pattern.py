# You are given a number n. You need to generate and print a pattern based on the given value of n.
# For each row, starting from the first, print numbers in descending order from n down to 1.
# Each number in a row is repeated as many times as the current row index (starting from n).
# Instead of printing each row on a new line, separate rows with -1.
# Instead of a newline at the end of each row, print -1 to indicate row separation. 
# After printing the entire pattern, end the output with -1.

# For n= 3,
# pattern:  3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1
#           3 3 2 2 1 1 
#           3 2 1

# For n= 2,
# pattern:  2 2 1 1
#           2 1
