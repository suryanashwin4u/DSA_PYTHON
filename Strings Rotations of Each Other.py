# You are given two strings s1 and s2, of equal lengths. 
# The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

# Note: A string is a rotation of another if it can be formed by moving characters 
# from the start to the end (or vice versa) without rearranging them.

# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Auxiliary Space: O(n)

class Solution:
    def areRotations(self, s1, s2):
        if len(s1) != len(s2):
            return False

        return s2 in (s1 + s1)
